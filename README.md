# PiCasso
CS121B Pi
`Drew Meyers, Cam Hudson, Alex Farrell`

Raspberry Pi powered robot that gets pictures tweeted at its Twitter account and converts them
into paintings, drawing the painting out based on the user's preference. We weren't able to finish
implementing PiCasso's drawing functionality but it is able to convert and display images as paintings.

# Note
This was my first major project from a few years ago so this represents the "beginning" of my software development career.
